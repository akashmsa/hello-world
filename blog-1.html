        <h3><b>Day 1, 27th June 2018, Destination - Yercaud</b></h3>
        <p>Well the day has come where we have been waited for such a long time, after so many flop plans, this one was on the cards. It was 7 pm, i left office early and rushed to pick my friend from his place since it was already late, i reached my friend's place @8 pm, picked him, started towards the Electronic city nice road where the other two of my friend's were already awaiting us.</br>
        We were four of us(Me,Ambi,Suhas,Sangamesh). We met near Electronic City and we started to ride @9:30, the above pic took exactly when we are about to start, plan was to ride till late night and stay somewhere near to the place we had planned to reach on day 1, the roads were superb so we crossed Hosur, Dharmapuri in no time, it took around 2 n half hr or max 3 hrs to reach there, it was around 12:30 am, we were near Thoppur we all were tired AF, so we decided to take a rest that night and leave early in the morning for Yercaud, we found some lodge near by and got a room for 800, as soon as we hit the room everyone went asleep since all were tired. We encountered some guests in the room, bedbugs, since most of us were tired i din come to know that, but Sangamesh was the one who slept on the floor because of that.</p></br></br>

       <h3><b>Day 2, 28th June 2018, Destination - Puduchery</b></h3>
        <p>We woke up at 6 am, got ourselfs ready and left for Yercaud, the place was beautiful as seen in the internet, the road was almost like a roller coaster, most of the kms we covered through ghat sections. While enjoing the view we kept riding towards Yercaud, we stopped in between to take some nice pictures, above is one of them, me taking the selfie, right to me is Suhas, left is Sangamesh, and the back one is Ambi.</br>
        Continued to ride and on the way we encountered so many places one of them is a karadiyur View Point, a beautifull place where u can see some spectacular view, road is not so good to the view point, but once you reach there you feel a worth coming there.</p>
      </div>

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>It was tough riding my P220 on those roads only because of the ground clearance, the ground clearance is as low as the center stand will touch even if u go through a small hump or you bend it just a little bit around the corner when you have a pillion with you, i had Ambi as my pillion, he is little bit skinny so i could manage in most of the humps, but cant help in the corners. </br>
        There was a falls near by, Kiliyur Falls, we went there, since it was not a monsoon, there was no water there, the water in the falls was like how it comes from the tap in your home, we din't spend much time over there.</br>
        We continued towards another view point nearby, Pagoda View Point, saw some spectacular view from the top, one intresting thing which happened there was, we ate the boiled sweet-corn as the breakfast, we just took 2 cups to taste it first, later we ate it like a breakfast, the combination of sweet-spicy-lime was tooo good for us, finally we ate for around 250 rs, one cup costs around 20.</p>

      <img src="images/blogs/blog-1/blog-1-3-2.jpg" alt="Nature" style="width:48%;float:left;">
       <div class="w3-container">
        <p>We left Pagoda View Point after some time, headed towards Puduchery since we thought it might get dark before we reach, we wanted to see the sunset over there, so we were cruising around 110 kmph, we stopped near Ambur highway to have lunch, we had "kothu-parotta" famous tamilnadu dish, suggested by Suhas, it was good though, tasted for the first time ever.</br>
        The ride continued, switched the pillions, now Sangamesh is with me as my pillion, started to speed up, cruising around 115kmph now, in between suhas has stopped to fill the petrol and he ran-out of cash, he had the debit card with him, but its of no use since the Petrol Bunk people din't had the swipe facility nor there were any ATM's nearby, by the way Ambi's bag was with me so he also had no cash, funny part is he realised that he has ran-out of cash after filling the petrol, once he realised he called me, since i was cruising around 115kmph i was approx 5-7 kms ahead of them, luckily i took out my phone while riding just to see the time, i got a call from Ambi (pure coincidence) he explained me, then i took a U-Turn to there place where he had stopped. Things sorted, wasted some good 30 mins of time, started towards puduchery. On the way to puduchery we crossed cudaloor and we reached cudaloor beach to view the sunset, but our bad luck, earlier we wasted some time that costed us with missing the sunset in cudaloor, with a sad face we started towards puduchery which is just 17 kms away from cudaloor. Finally we reached puduchery took some villa which costed us 12k for 2 days. One of our friend Avinash had come from Chennai to join us, we reached the villa, everyone took shower, ordered biryani for dinner, and went to sleep.</p>

       <h3><b>Day 3, 29th June 2018, Rock Beach</b></h3>
        <p>Everyone Slept Well Last night, Woke up around 9 am, we had a small pool in the villa, enjoyed playing there, we played finding the hidden lemon inside that pool, it was awsome. We took a moped(Activa) for rent, since Avinash has joined from Chennai, we had breakfast and then we left for the Rock-Beach, the temperature was around 31 degrees, it was like super hot there in Rock Beach, but somehow we managed to roam around Rock-Beach, took some nice photos, visited the Sri Aurobindo Ashram, spent some quality time over there, headed back to the villa, because of the heat over there, we were tired again, once we reached back our villa, Avinash had cooked us a Egg-Maggie, it was good, we all had Maggie, left from the villa to see another beach, i forgot that name, there was nothing much to see in that beach, paradise beach i guess, i'm not sure, we returned to Rock-Beach to view the night life over there, it was tooo good, roaming on the streets of the Rock-Beach, that too after sunset is superb. After spending some quality time there we head back to our villa, on the way Sangamesh gave us a dinner party, thanks to him, as soon as we reached we hit the bed because we had to vacate the villa next morning.</p>

       <h3><b>Day 4, 30th June 2018, Mahabalipuram</b></h3>
        <p>Everyone woke up early, Avinash had to return back to Chennai, he left, we started to ride towards Mahabalipuram @8am, it is somewhere around 95 kms to reach, it was hot conditions out there, no option other than continuing with the ride, now we switched the bike, i took bullet and Ambi was riding my 220, on the way we saw some place where they extract salt from sea, a narrow stretch land covered with nothing apart from raw sand, unfortunately we couldn't stop there, we reached mahabalipuram, saw the temple which is located near the beach, since it was very hot conditions out there we decided to leave early, we left Mahabalipuram around @12pm, reached Kanchipuram, Waited till 4pm since the temple opens at 4pm, went inside the temple got blessings, now its time to head back to bangalore, by the time we left Kanchipuram it was 5pm, we started again with the ride, plan was to stop in Vellore to see the Vellore golden temple, but since it ws very late we decided not to go there, but in Vellore Suhas went to his relative home and decided to stay there since there was some function in there home. So he stayed back and we 3 continued with the ride, by the time we left Vellore it was around 6-6:30, we started and decided to reach bangalore as early as possible. I was riding my 220 alone, we stopped twice while returning bangalore, one is for tea break near Ambur, another for fuel break near Krishnagiri. Finally we reached bangalore around 11pm, decided to stay @Sangamesh's place since it was late night. Later i woke up early in the morning and reached my home(Magadi).</br></br>
        This was one hell of a ride for me, because i learnt so many things in this ride.</br></br>
        Hope, soon will plan an other ride, which will give me more kick than this.</br></br>
        Since this was our longest trip i decided to write it out somewhere so that after some years i can recollect the memories by reading this.</br></br>
        Thanks for Reading, hope you guys like it!, if you like this share with your friends, until next time, Bye for now.
