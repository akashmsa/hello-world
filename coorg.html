        <h3><b>Day 1, 24th November 2019, Destination - Madikeri</b></h3>
        <p>It was saturday around 8 am, i had just opened my eyes from sleep, took my mobile (first thing which i do once i wake up), had a missed call from suhas, called him up, he picked my call after 3 rings, <b>Me :</b> Y did u call ?, <b>Suhas :</b> R u Free today ?,<b> Me :</b> yes i am, <b>Suhas :</b> Ok, don't make it late getting ready, go get fresh up, pack sme clothes, we are gng to Madikeri, don't even hve breakfast, we'l have it on the way, i'l see you in Ramanagara in 40 mins, <b>Me :</b> i said ok happily (i'm a kind of guy who never says "No" when it comes for a bike ride, wake me up midnight saying we'l go for a ride, i'l be ready). This is how the Coorg ride happened, welcome to the Blog.</br></br>
        As soon i hung up the call with him i got up from my bed, got myself fresh, packed a pair of clothes, searched for my riding gears, took the camera with me (Helmet Cam), i was all set to leave, informed my mom and dad that i'm gng for a ride and i'l be back on next day, they just said ok be carefull, everyone will be wondering how my parents will agree without saying any word, even me, i don know, may be because they know what their son is up to, i don't even think of going somewhere without informing them, so may be because i do that, they never said the word "don't go" to me, blessed to have them as my parents. It was already 9 am, to do all this stuffs, i thought suhas would already reached Ramanagara since he said he will be in 40 mins, i left home at 9, on the way i called him to ask whether he has already reached or not, but as always he do, he haven't left his home yet, he was like it became late, had some conversation, finally i said ok, come soon i will be in Ramanagara bus stop. I reached Ramanagara around 9:45, it is just 35kms from my home (Magadi). Since i had reached early, i went to Ramanagara bus stop and sat there while waiting for suhas.
        </p></br></br>

        <p>Finally he came at around 10:15am, we searched for the nearest Petrol Bunk, fueld up for 500rs for my 220, filled the air with 28 PSI for the front, 32 PSI for the rear wheel. At 10:30am we left from Ramanagara, the Bangalore - Mysore road is beautiful as everyone knows, so we reached mysore in no time, it took us 1 n half hr to cover good 98 kms, we stopped near columbia asia hospital signal, mysore, where we have to take right turn to go further towards kushalnagara. Since we din't had breakfast we decided to have breakfast, i had poori, he had lemon rice, we were done and left that place, till Hunsur it is a double lane road so we enjoyed the ride, but after crossing Hunsur, all the way till Kushalnagara it is a single lane road, so we were bit carefull while riding, now its time for some experiments, i took out the helmet camera, mounted to my helmet near chin, started recording, the recordings din come well though, so i deleted those clips. </br>We reached kushalnagara at 2:30pm, we thought of going to the dam near by (Herur Dam), but few auto guys told that there is no water there so if you go you will be dissapionted, rather they suggested to go to the place called Nisargadhama which is jus around 5 kms, good they suggested this place because it was superb going there, we never knew this place will be this much beautifull, especially me, we went there parked our bikes took the park ticket, went inside, since it was a weekend there were so many people around, so many school groups had arrived, i just got angry thinking about my school management, y the hell they din't take us to the places like this when i was in school, anyway now i have seen this place so no problem, the weather was perfect out there. What special about this park is the Kaveri river flows inside this, thats what attracts the tourists, if they din't have that there, it has got no value. We went near water took some pictures spent some time there then decided to leave. If you guys go near Kushalnagara, don't forget to visit this place. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Nisargadhama/@12.4420349,75.9308267,16z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ba5082f7e52343f:0xa8f863116262694d!8m2!3d12.4407439!4d75.9361629" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color:orange;padding: 3px;background-color: black;border-radius:10px;">Click here to view on map</a>.</p>

        <p>We left Nisargadhama and started towards Madikeri, but later we decided we will go Dubare Elephant Camp on the same day since we were not sure about the route which we take while coming back. It is just 20 kms away from Nisargadhama, we reached Dubare Elephant Camp at 4pm, we need to cross the kaveri river to go near the Elephant Camp, there was a huge queue for the boat ride which takes you to the other way, so we planned like this, i'l stand in queue, suhas will go front faking to ask something with boat people and if he get a chance he will join the queue in middle and call me also to join in between, but it din't work out for us, but we had an other news, since there was a huge queue, the boat guy was shouting like, if anyone can cross this river barefoot, can do, go ahead, i was like what !!!!!!, we went to him and asked can we cross this? he said yes you can, go ahead, by the time some guys started to cross the river, so we decided to cross, trust me it was wonderfull experience, we stood in the middle of the river and took some nice photos, crossing the river barefoot was the next level experience for me, the water level was no where higher than your knee height, some places it is near to waist height. Should be carefull with our belongings while crossing and should be very carefull with out steps. I suggest everyone should do this atleast once in your life to experience the thrill of that. <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Dubare+Elephant+Camp/@12.4141004,75.900144,13z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x3ba5a6213b0cc98d:0x40de9c04d7600912!8m2!3d12.370573!4d75.9054101" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;color:orange;padding: 3px;background-color: black;border-radius:10px;">Click here to view on map</a>.</p></p>

        <p>We roamed around the Dubare Camp, taking photos with the big guys, playing with the small ones, i was enjoying my time there. Later we decided to leave the place since it was getting dark and we had to reach Madikeri as soon as possible, while returning from Dubare we took a boat ride 30rs per head for the ride.</br>We left Dubare at 5pm, started towards Madikeri, roads were beautiful, loved each and every corner which i encountered while riding, all i can say is, i was enjoying the ride to the core.</br> We reached Madikeri around 6:30pm, stood near Madikeri bus stop to search for some nice place to stay that night, some random people started approaching us asking do you need a room? since tourism is a main income source for them they will approach as soon as you stand in Madikeri with some bagpack, We decided we will google and book some room since the guy who approached us asked for 1200 rs, but later some other guy approached us asking the same question, as we din't find anything on google for our budget, we somehow bargained with him and asked him for 800rs, he agreed for that, went to the room. Just 15mins after reaching the room it started to rain, thank god that we din't wasted our time searching for rooms on google else we would have been drenched. We got freshed up, thought to see some movie in mobile, since we din't get sleep, but the network was horrible, there was a buffer of more than 30 secs for every 5 secs of play, so movie was out of the cards.</br> Since Sangamesh, Ambi & Avinash din't make out for the ride, decided to call them, we all were on conference call, we spoke for more than and hour, it was so much fun talikng wiith them, cracking some non-veg jokes, teasing each others, ufff what not!. Slept around 11 pm i guess. We decided to leave early next day.</p>

       <h3><b>Day 2, 25th November 2018, Raja's Seat, Abbey Falls, Mandalpatti</b></h3>
        <p>Woke up early morning at 5:30 am, both got freshup and we vacated the rooom at 6:30 am, we went near Raja's Seat View point, the view was awsome, since it wasn't planned we din't take DSLR Camera, all those pictures are taken from mobile. We spent some time there in Raja's Seat, now it's time to see the most visited place in Madikeri, its Abbey Falls, the road to Abbey Falls is not so good, it has not maintained well, you will see atleast a 3 potholes for every 5 meters.</p>

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>We reached Abbey Falls, spent some time there taking photos, but we also saw the disaster which had happend just a month before we had went there, because of rain and flood, you can't even imagine the loss which has happned there, nature loss, property loss, life loss. We saw the damaged house which was alone in the forest, we saw the people searching for their belongings inside the mud, it was a hearbreak moment for me thinking about the future of those people. But we couldn't do anything apart from feeling sad. Din't stayed too long there, decided to go back to madikeri, but again changed the plan and decided to go Mandalpatti.

      <div class="w3-container">
        <p>The Road to Mandalpatti is too bad to cover, because of the disaster which has happened, you can't even think of taking a pillion with you and ride there. If anyone have an idea to go there, go to madikeri and take a jeep which takes you to the top of mandalpatti, don't go with your own vehicle, especially car, if you are single on bike, then you can go ahead.</br>
        I love to ride off road so it din't matter to me whether the road is good or not, all i was worried is about my bike, what if smething goes wrong, because we had to ride back home, luckily nthng like that happend, we went to top, saw some spectacular view, as i said earlier we missed the DSLR very badly here. While coming back from Mandalpatti we did some river cross challenge, you can see the video below, took some nice photos there.

        <p>By the time we left Mandalpatti it was around 9 am, we decided to go back home soon and rest for the day since next day we both had to go office. Suhas told there is Tibetan Golden Temple named "Padmasambhava buddhist vihara" near Kushalnagara, so we decided to go there, we reached the Golden Temple around 11am, went inside, spent some quality time over there, it was so peacefull out there. Took some photos, spent around an hour there, then we headed back towards Bangalore.</br>
        While coming back we took the other route which joins via Arakalagudu, Holenarasipura, Channarayapattana. We stopped near Holenarasipura since we dint stop anywhere for the past 1hr. Both of us drank coconut water (essential while riding), started again with the ride back home, touched the Bangalore - Hassan highway, from there on it was all about speed, superb roads allowed both of us to speed up around 110 kmph.</br>
        Till Bellur Cross it was boring, but after bellur cross some guy overtook me riding his pulsar 220, so i decided lets not do this as some boring ride, the race mode was on, started to revv as much as i can to overtake him, finally overtook him within the next 2 mins, maintained the race mode till Kunigal Bypass, overtaking each and every vehicle out there. Stopped near Kunigal Bypass since i had to take right to reach my home (Magadi). We rested for some 20 mins there, later Suhas continued with his ride to Bangalore, i reached home safely around 4pm. He texted that he reached around 5pm. Successfully the unplanned coorg ride was completed. Cheeers! </br></br>
